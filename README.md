# Data Science Internship FILKOM UB
This project is a Data Scientist based approach towards data management. It was done under the guidance of Mr. Fitra A. Bachtiar, lecturer and supervisor, of my Team. For short, this project is about conducting a research on the effects of students mental conditions towards their academic achievement. It was conducted for about a month of data gathering using questionnaires from students using the HSS Learning website, which is a basic HTML and CSS Learning course. The project was titled "ANALISIS SISI AFEKTIF PADA TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTED LEARNING PEMBELAJARAN HTML DAN CSS DENGAN PENDEKATAN DATA SCIENCE" or "ANALYSIS OF THE AFFECTIVE SIDE OF TECHNOLOGY SUPPORTED LEARNING HTML AND CSS LEARNING WITH A DATA SCIENCE APPROACH". Here we used three different questionnaires to measure and determined a students emotional category with:
1. AEQ-S (Achievement Emotion Questionnaire short version)
2. DASS 21 (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale)
3. ERQ (Emotion Regulation Questionnaire)
And two other questionnaire of Pretest and Posttest that determined an individual's score before and after learning at the HSS Learning Website.

A lot of methods are used to do the analysis of whats considered a "Data Science" approach such as:
- Preprocessing
- Clustering using K Means, Gaussian Mixture, and Fuzzy C Means
- Asscosiation using Apriori and FP-Growth
- Classification using Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, and K-Nearest Neighbor

We also have to make a dashboard using Streamlit in order to compile all of our results in a more generally user-friendly information as part of our Dashboarding process

Feel free to check out the code and if there is any questions just let me know!
